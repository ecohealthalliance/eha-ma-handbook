# Amazon Web Services 

- _What if my data files are too big to hold in Github?_
- _Where is the latest IUCN/MODIS/LANDSAT shapefile?_
- _What if I need more CPUs than even Aegypti has?_


EHA has an organizational Amazon Web Services account that may be useful for some projects. **AWS S3 storage** is useful for hosting large data files. AWS EC2 cloud computers may be appropriate for a hosting a web app or database, automating regular processes, or other analytical projects.

- Contact Noam for access to the AWS account, to discuss whether AWS will be useful for your project, or to discuss other cloud resources.
- All resources used on AWS need to be tagged with a project:PROJECTNAME tag in order to assign costs to the appropriate EHA projects.
- Be judicious with AWS service usage. It is easy to run up costs.

## Log on

Once you've gotten your credentials from Noam, log on to [ehatek.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/](ehatek.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/). `ehatek` should be already entered in the "Account ID or alias" field. You will be asked to change your password after the first time you log on. 

## Generate an access key

Navigate to your IAM (Identity and Access Management) page to generate an access key. This will allow you to download data from private S3 buckets, for example, via R.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if(!require(emo)) devtools::install_github("hadley/emo", quiet = TRUE)
```


You should see a `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` next to "rotate your access keys." Click "Manage User Access Keys" after expanding the access key subheading.  (If you see an `r emo::ji("x")`, check in with Noam that you have the appropriate S3 privileges.)

Click the "Security credentials" panel and scroll down to the "create access key" button.

Your access key will have a `key ID` - a long string of letters and numbers - and a `*~*secret*~* access key` - a longer string of letters and numbers. Press "show" and hang onto it somewhere until you are sure your `~/.aws/credentials` file is working as intended. **Don't share your secret key with anyone**. 

If you lose it before you use it, you can delete it and make another one. *Deleting* a key is different from making a key *inactive* - you might reach your access key limit pretty quickly, so you'll probably have to do the former if you have keys that you don't use. 

## Create a credentials file 

Open a blank text file in a text editor and paste your key ID and secret key as follows. It will look like this:

```
[default]
*your_key_ID*
*your_secret_access_key*
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1"
```

Replace `*your_key_ID*` and `*your_secret_access_key*` with the values you see in the AWS browser.

Create a folder called `~/.aws`, and put the `credentials` file in it. 

(**YES**, currently, you need that trailing `"` after `us-east-1` if you want to include the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION in your credentials file, because the `aws.signature` is using a strange parser.)

If you get errors related to the AWS default region, you can delete that line and set it locally inside your R environment like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setenv("AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-1")
```

## Testing your Key 

Open an R session to make sure your credentials file works. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(aws.s3)) devtools::install_github("cloudyr/aws.s3")
if (!require(aws.signature)) devtools::install_github("cloudyr/aws.signature")

library(aws.s3)

# load credentials from your credentials file 
aws.signature::use_credentials()

# check list of aws S3 buckets 
head(aws.s3::bucketlist())
```

If you get a '403 Forbidden' error, your credentials aren't working. 

### Alternate credentialing method 

If you have Done Your Googles and are still having trouble setting your AWS credentials, you can set them inside your R environment. The advantage of using an `~/.aws/credentials` file is that your key will then work across all platforms - R, Python, the command line, etc. However, if you're only connecting to AWS through R, the code below will be enough. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" = "*your_key_ID*",
           "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" = "*your_secret_access_key*",
           "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-1",)
```

## Exploring S3 buckets

You used `bucketlist` above to list all the buckets associated with your account. To look at everything inside a specific bucket, use `get_bucket`.

Note that Amazon **charges per Gigabyte for downloading and uploading files.** Use things as needed for your project, but don't get crazy and put a file download inside a for loop that you're running a thousand times a day. Why would you do this?

To test privacy privileges are working are intended, we'll use a very small private bucket with ~4 KB in it - Two small subsets of the Social Security Administration's baby names dataset from the `babynames` package. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# check list of aws S3 buckets 
bucketlist()

# aws.s3::bucketlist()
pb <- "eha-ma-practice-bucket"
b <- get_bucket(pb)
b
```

## Getting objects from buckets  

You can then `get` a specific object out of the bucket. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bns <- get_object(b[[1]], bucket = pb)
```

The raw output of `get_object` will be likely at first be unrecognizable. 

For most filetypes (.csv, .xml, .zip, etc.), rawToChar will be needed convert the file first before reading it in with `read_csv`, `readxml` or other functions used to read files into R. (See also the `get_object` help file). 

This 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 

babynames_subset <- read_csv(rawToChar(bns))
```

## Saving objects 

To `put` something back into the bucket, use `put_object` or `s3save`. `put_object` is more useful to save something from your computer (or from a temp file) like a .csv or .zip file, while `s3save` saves it directly as an S3 object. 

In this example, we'll make a change to the `babynames_subset` and save it as a new file (`babynames_subset2`). We'll save it as both an S3 object and a .csv to show that the objects are the same. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
babynames_subset2 <- babynames_subset %>% 
    group_by(name) %>% 
    summarize(n = sum(n)) %>% 
    filter(n < 100) 

# to save as s3 
s3save(babynames_subset2, object = "babynames_subset2", bucket = pb)
```

Alternately, we could save as a .csv. We'll do both in this example to demonstrate that they're the same. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# to save as some other kind of object wihtout saving to your computer permanently 
tmp <- tempfile()
on.exit(unlink(tmp))
write.csv(babynames_subset2, file = tmp, row.names = FALSE)

put_object(tmp, object = "babynames_subset2.csv", bucket = pb) # if the object already exists on your computer, you just need this line 

```

So now we have a data frame in memory called `babynames_subset2`, an S3 object in AWS called `babynames_subset2`, and a .csv in AWS called `babynames_subset2.csv`. We'll pull them all back into memory to make sure they're the same. 

To do this, we have to first copy over `babynames_subset2` to a new object in memory and remove it so that when we load the version from AWS, it doesn't overwrite it. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
babynames_subset_R <- babynames_subset2 
rm(babynames_subset2)

# read the .csv object the same way as before 
bns <- get_object(b[[3]], bucket = pb)
babynames_subset2_csv <- read_csv(rawToChar(bns))

```

If the object is an S3 object, you don't have to use `charToRaw` when reading it in. Instead, you will need to wrap it in `load(rawConnection( object ))`. For example: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# GET the raw object from AWS and load it into memory 
bs3 <- get_object(b[[2]], bucket = pb)
# bs3 <- get_object("babynames_subset2", bucket = "eha-ma-practice-bucket") # explicitly
load(rawConnection(bs3))


```

Finally, we can check that the object in memory, the .csv in AWS, and the S3 object in AWS are all the same. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
assertthat::are_equal(babynames_subset_R, babynames_subset2)
assertthat::are_equal(babynames_subset_R, babynames_subset2_csv)
```
