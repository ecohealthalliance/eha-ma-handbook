# Project Management {#projects}

## Teams and Work Cycles

At EHA *projects* are typically months-to-years-long workstreams centered around
a main analytical or research problem. A program, grant or contract may have
multiple projects, and a project may have multiple outputs such as reports,
scientific publications, or apps. A project typically has a small (2-5 person
team) with a project lead and possibly a project administrative point of contact
(APOC).

We organize projects into *work cycles* of 4-8 weeks. For each cycle, a team
should define day-to-week scale tasks, assign tasks to members, determine the
percentage of time team members will put towards the project in that cycle,
given other workloads, and plan travel, reporting, collaboration, or other
deadlines.

Teams report out their progress at the end (and start) of each work cycle at our
weekly M&A meetings. Report-outs should include

-   Progress on tasks assigned and completed in previous cycle
-   Substantive report-out of results and products
-   Draft plan for tasks and goals for the coming cycle
-   Team assignments for the next cycle and level of involvement (high
    (&gt;50%), medium (25%-50%, low (&lt;25%)) of team memberss over the cycle.
-   Any additional deadlines or reporting anticipated in that time frame,
    including plans for other internal presentations or feedback sessions.

During report-outs, the M&A group will provide feedback for the upcoming cycle
and set a date for the next one.

Teams track work cycle progress through various mechanisms based on team
preferences. One option is GitHub Milestones
([Example](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/asl2050-ai/milestones)). Others
use Google Spreadsheets, [Asana](https://asana.com/), or other systems. Teams
may choose what they prefer as long as their system

-   Shows current tasks, deadlines, and assignments Tracks past tasks,
    deadlines, and assignments
-   Includes top-level summaries for a reporting period
-   Is available in "real time" online rather than stored on individual machines
    and e-mailed
-   Can be made accessible to other staff via a URL but kept private within EHA

## Setup and materials Organization

An M&A project lasting more than one work cycle should typically have a Slack
channel for communication, a GitHub repo for data and analysis code, or Dropbox
or Google Drive folder for documents or materials not appropriate for git-based
version control. In addition, it may have a Paperpile folder for references. In
general, one URL (often the GitHub README) should be the starting point from
which one can reach all project materials.

### Code organization

In general, one should aim to set up the analysis portion of a project in a
self-contained way, with clear separation between raw data, processed data,
exploratory analyses, and final products. In organizing a project folder, ask

-   *If I copied this whole folder onto someone else's computer, could they pick
    up the project?*
-   *Are the folder organization and file naming clear?*

-   There are some exceptions for large data sets or rapidly changing data sets.
    In these cases, data can be organized as a separate folder or project, and
    large data sets can be store in an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket.

-   In many cases it is actually best for data to be organized as a *separate
    resource* from analysis. This allows multiple analysis projects to rely on
    the same upstream data project, avoiding multiple versions of data. Data may
    also not be best stored in a git repository but in a project database to be
    pulled for analyses.
 
 
#### `targets`

We recommend that analysis projects be set up using the
[`targets`](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/targets-example) framework to
define steps in the code.  `targets` is a package for defining R project workflow
and tracks your functions and objects to ensure everything is up-to-date.  Here
are some resources for getting started with `targets`

-  An internal presentation on using `targets` at EHA: ([Video (via password at internal AirTable)](https://airtable.com/appwlxIzmQx5njRtQ/tbledVCO9MRKkK9MW/viwgVEpgZnmyrILmZ/recNumz1XdgbOtuaQ?blocks=hide),

    a [walkthrough](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html)

-   [A good intro talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU1Zv21GvT4)(\~90 mins
    with questions) by Miles McBain on using targets and getting a good workflow

-   A great [introductory video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbc6NX1n01Q&list=PLvgdJdJDL-APJqHy5CXs6m4N7hUVp5rb4) (5 30-minute lessons as a YouTubePlaylist)

In general we also prefer that R analyses be set up as [RStudio projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).
