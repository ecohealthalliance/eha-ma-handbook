# Dependency Management {#dependencies}

*How do I make sure that all my software and configurations needed for a projects are portable?*


- [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) captures package versions and sources as well as R version. `renv` also records python versions and virtual environments for projects that used both languages. 
    - The [capsule](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/capsule) package can be useful when you want version control/depedency management but not the full weight of `renv`. Sometimes, `renv` can be an impediment for smaller and highly collaborative projects, that is where capsule can be useful. Ultimately, capsule will allow to setup `renv` for a project when it gets to a stable state.  

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) allows you to create virtual machines, meaning you can capture all system dependencies in addition to the dependencies captured in `renv`. It works for essentially any programming language and is extremely flexible.

-   R packages can be a useful project output. We have some in-house R packages to provide access to internal data and generate reports, and may be developing more for external audiences. Hadley Wickham's [R Packages Book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) provides guidance for these, and we expect our packages to be up to [rOpenSci standards](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding).


Historically some projects used [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) or [checkpoint](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=checkpoint) to fix R package versions. These systems have been superceded by `renv`.
