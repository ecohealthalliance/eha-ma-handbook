# Version Control and Collaboration

-   *Can I go back to before I made that mistake?*
-   *Can others see changes others have made to the project and can I see
    theirs?*

**Version control** is essential to long-term project management and
collaboration. We primarily use git for this - we recommend it for any project
with more than one file of code. It has a steep learning curve but is very
powerful.

-   [GitHub](http://github.com) is a web service for sharing git-versioned
    projects that has many great tools for collaboration. We have an
    organizational GitHub account so we can have private repositories and work
    in teams with shared projects.

-   For projects with little code-based work, there are other options, as well:
    -   Google Docs/Word Track Changes are limited to *single documents*
    -   Dropbox can track all files in a shared project/folder
        -   Allows one to view/revert to any previous version of a file in the
            folder
        -   Easily sharable
        -   Does not travel well - history is lost when project moves elsewhere
        -   File histories are independent - does not track interrelated
            changes.
-   Avoid filename-based version control:

## Learn

Git has a steep learning curve and we recommend you spend some time learning
rather than only trying to pick it up as you go along.

-   Here is a good video course
    ([Part1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpUDlhh8I2E) /
    [Part2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8TLL05qVFg)), based on the
    [Software Carpentry curriculum](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).
    (Links to the syllabus are in the notes below the videos.)
-   [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/) is a great reference for the
    nuts and bolts of connecting your git, GitHub and R workflows

## Install

-   Go through the installation steps [Happy Git with
    R](http://happygitwithr.com/)'s "Installation" and "Connect" chapters and
    Appendix B
-   Note when setting up your GitHub account that one account can have multiple
    e-mail addresses associated with it, so you can split your work and personal
    stuff without needing multiple accounts (see
    [here](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-emails-for-organizations/)).
-   Give [Noam](ross@ecohealthalliance.org) (Modeling & Analytics) or
    [Toph](allen@ecohealthalliance.org) (Tech), your GitHub username so they can
    make you a member of the [organizational EHA
    account](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance) and be given access to the
    appropriate teams.
-   If you are using a GitHub account you previously created with another
    e-mail, be sure to add your EHA e-mail under [Email
    Settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications) and set "Custom
    Routing" under [your notification
    settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications) so that notifications
    related to the EHA organization go to your EHA e-mail.
-   Install Dropbox on your computer with your EHA account (note you can have
    separate personal and EHA Dropbox folders)
-   Check that your EHA email gives you access to Google Drive. If you prefer
    it, or your supervisor specifies it, [install it locally on your
    computer](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive)
