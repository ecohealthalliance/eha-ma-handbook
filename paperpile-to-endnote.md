## Converting Paperpile Citations in Google Docs to Endnote Citations in MS Word

Paperpile is an excellent tool for sharing and keeping track of research papers, and it is fully integrated into Google Docs -- which means you can easily add citations on shared documents. 

However, there are some situations where you may need to convert a Google Doc with Paperpile citations into a Microsoft Word Document with Endnote citations. Luckily, Paperpile has a detailed guide to walk you through the process.

__But first, you must properly install the Paperpile Google Docs Add-on!__ 

- Note: You may already have the Google Chrome Paperpile Extension installed and be using it to create citations in your Google Doc, but you need the Google Docs Add-on for proper exporting. 

To install this addon, follow the links from Paperpile's [website dedicated to Google Docs](https://paperpile.com/blog/free-google-docs-add-on/).

Now, when you open a document in Google Docs, you should see both menus for *Addons* and *Paperpile*. In order to begin Step 1 of Paperpile's Endnote Guide, you need to access the add-on sidebar:  

- Go to *Addons* $\rightarrow$ *Paperpile* $\rightarrow$ *Manage Citations* and the Paperpile side-bar will appear
- __Don't try to export or mess around with the *Paperpile* menu option (or P symbol) -- they won't help you!__

Once you have the add-on sidebar open, you can follow Paperpile's [detailed guide](http://forum.paperpile.com/t/guide-export-a-google-document-to-word-endnote/777). 

- Note: depending on your operating system and your edition of Microsoft Word, some of the Word menus may appear slightly different than the ones depicted in Paperpile's guide. However, the Paperpile images included in the guide should look *exactly the same*.
