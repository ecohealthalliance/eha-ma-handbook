# Dependency Management {#dependencies}

*How do I make sure that all my software and configurations needed for a project
are portable?*

-   [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) or
    [checkpoint](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=checkpoint) to fix R package
    versions.
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for everything
    -   [A lesson in user Docker for an R
        project](http://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/)
-   Makefiles can automate a complex, multipart project. Here's [a lesson on
    them from Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/)

-   R packages can be a useful project output. We have some in-house R packages
    to provide access to internal data and generate reports, and may be
    developing more for external audiences. Hadley Wickham's [R Packages
    Book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) provides guidance for these, and we expect
    our packages to be up to [rOpenSci
    standards](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding).
