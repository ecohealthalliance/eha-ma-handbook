# Contributing a Chapter {#Contributing}

*How do I add a chapter to the EHA M&A Handbook?*

This handbook is created using the `[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)`
package. `Bookdown` allows you to publish a set of Rmarkdown documents into a book. Each document constitutes a chapter in the book. Chapters are meant to provide sufficient information for a naive reader to gain an understanding of the topic and begin to apply it. Unless the topic is not well covered by outside resources, chapters do not need to cover the topic indepth. 

This chapter assumes an introductory level understanding of git. See the chapter on [git](#versionControl) to learn more.

## Anatomy of a chapter
