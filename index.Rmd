# Introduction {-}

(_This handbook last updated `r as.character(as.Date(git2r::when(git2r::commits()[[1]])))`_)

This handbook describes best practices and guidelines for project manamgment,
organization, modeling and and programming we aim for our on the EHA Modeling &
Analytics team.

In general, we aim to produce sound analyses that are:

-   Self-contained
-   Well-documented and communicated
-   Easily reproducible
-   Sharable
-   Version controlled

Together, these attributes help assure that our work is correct, can be
built off of and extended, meets requirements for sharing and
publication, and can be continued through staff turnover.

The tools we use to accomplish this are mostly, but not exclusively,
based around the R programming language and git version control. Other
teams at EHA use other tools (e.g., the technology team mostly uses
Python and Javascript, much of our work with partners is MS Office
based).

The guidelines in the document represent an ideal we aim for but to not
always attain. Remember:

-   Best practices are always evolving.
-   Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
-   Other teams and external partners have different workflows and we
    adjust as neccessary to collaborate.
-   Our goal is to do good science to advance conservation and human
    health, not be slick programmers.

You can find some slides from a previous presentation on this topic
[here](selfish-reproducibility-NR-2016-01-26.pdf).

The philosophy and guidelines in this document owe an enormous amount to
the work of the [Software and Data
Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and
[rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/) organizations, and the work of [Hadley
Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) and [Jenny
Bryan](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/). You'll find many links to their
work in this handbook.
