# Training Resources and Plans

If you are planning on spending significant time improving your data science and modeling skills, you will want to create a _training plan_.  A training plan is required if you
would like to use EHA's Data Camp account.  Data Camp provides excellent modular courses comprised of both video and interactive, automatically graded exercises to learn data science and coding.  

## Training plan components

-  A description of your goals for the training plans and to which EHA projects
   and activities you will apply your skills
-  A list of courses/tutorials your plan to complete
-  The total time the courses will take to complete.  We find the estimated times of Data Camp courses are roughly accurrate. 
-  The time frame over which you expect to complete them
-  The name of a _peer learner_.  You should have a peer learner at EcoHealth who will be a partner over the course of your training.  This may be someone working on a similar training plan or someone with knowledge of the material already.  They should play some or all of these roles:
    -   Accountability: Your peer learner should know about your training plan and its time frame, and check in on how you are doing.
    -   Co-learning: Your learning peer and you may want to schedule times to watch course
        videos and complete exercises together
    -   Review: Especially for materials without automating like Data Camp, your peer learner should be able to look at your work and provide feedback
    -   Motivation:  Your peer learner should make your training fun and tell you that you rock. 

When your supervisor signs off on your training plan, contact Megan Walsh to
provide you with a Data Camp subscription for the period you need it.

## Training Plan 

_I request that if you take a course not on this list, you add it with your commentary
on its utility_

### Better Managing Project Data

-  [DataCamp: Introduction to the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) (4 hours) will get you started immediately working with data in R, and puts the following items in context.

-  Work through the [Data Carpentry lesson on spreadsheet organization](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/) (~2 hours) and
read [Hadley Wickham's paper on tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) (~1 hour)

- [DataCamp: Importing Data in R (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-r-part-1), (3 hours)

- [DataCamp: Cleaning Data in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-r) (4 hours)

### Version Control and Git

- Read through and work through the examples in [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/).

-  There is a Data Camp course [Introduction to Git for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science) (4 hours).  This is a more detailed  introduction that teaches you more about _how_ git works and features
we use less in our workflow.  It may be appropriate once you have jumped into a project
that uses git more elaborately.

### Improving Your Statistical Fundamentals

- [DataCamp: Introduction to Data](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-data) (4 hours) is a good starter course you have not much or any training in statistics in school and want to get familiar with the language and concepts.

- [DataCamp: Foundations of Probability in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/foundations-of-probability-in-r) (4 hours)

- [Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). This is an excellent book [and video lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdM9_N6XUUFrhghGJ4K25bFc) that gives builds great foundations for doing many types of modeling.  Prerequisites are Intermediate R, some experience with linear regression and probability (for which the DataCamp course above is a good basis).  This course has about 19 hours of video.  We recommend 2-3 months for going through the book, video, and exercises.

### Improving your data visualization

# Visualization

-  [Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Parts 1 + 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1) (5 + 5 hours).  Part 3 covers
   topics not generally needed.
   
-   [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](http://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) by Claus Wilke is an excellent guide to making high-quality figures, focusing more on design than mechanics of programming. R code is available for all of its examples.  If you feel you have a solid
grasp of **ggplot2** but want to improve the quality of your figures, we recommend reading this e-book, and using the accompanying code in [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz) to reproduce figures. 

-   [Reporting with R Markdown
](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown) (3 hours)

### R Programming

-   [DataCamp: Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) is a good place to back up a bit to fill in concepts if you are missing things to help understand other course sequences. 

-   [DataCamp: Intermediate R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r) (6 hours) or [DataCamp: Writing Functions in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-r)/ (4 hours) are both good courses to improve your skills if you find yourself managing a more complex workflow or working on an R package with someone at EHA. 

### Map-making and geospatial analysis in R

-   [Geocomputation in R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) is a comprehensive guide for understanding geographic data, mapping, and conducting spatial analysis in R. Likely, the most relevant chapters for your purposes are 1-8, 10-11. A chapter might take you 2-4 hours to work through, depending on how in depth you want to get and the number of exercises that you complete.

-   [Making Maps with R](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/making-maps-with-R.html) is a quick-start guide to mapping with **ggplot2**. It also introduces the **gmap**, **maps**, and **mapdata** packages for providing basemaps on which to overlay your spatial data.  

-  [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) is a manual on the use of the R **leaflet** package to harness (Leaflet)[https://leafletjs.com/], an open-source JS library for creating _interactive_ maps. Leaflet maps particularly useful for exploring and visualizing spatial data, and are easily embedded into R Markdown documents.  

-  DataCamp also has courses on spatial analysis using R, notably [Spatial Analysis in R with sf and raster](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/spatial-analysis-in-r-with-sf-and-raster) (4 hours) and [Interactive Maps with leaflet in R
](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/interactive-maps-with-leaflet-in-r) (4 hours).  You should take a course or have knowledge of R Markdown prior to taking this course.
